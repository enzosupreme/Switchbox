# Switchbox
Fightstick made with KMK. 
It has a swappable left side so you can switch between fightstck and hitbox.
The display displays the current layer and key layout for the layer assigned.
The layers can be changed via a rotary encoder on the back.
This is written with kmk firmware so it is currently PC only. ![18](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38119453/212520376-27c22922-8075-4c5f-a710-a1762be63bf4.gif)
